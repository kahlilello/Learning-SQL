# 1 The example uses a WHERE clause to show the cases in 'Italy' in March 2020. Modify the query to show data from Spain.

     confirmed, deaths, recovered
     FROM covid
    WHERE name = 'Spain'
    AND MONTH(whn) = 3 AND YEAR(whn) = 2020
    ORDER BY whn

# 2 The LAG function is used to show data from the preceding row or the table. When lining up rows the data is partitioned by country name and ordered by the data whn. That means that only data from Italy is considered. Modify the query to show confirmed for the day before.
  SELECT name, DAY(whn), confirmed,

#4 The data gathered are necessarily estimates and are inaccurate. However by taking a longer time span we can mitigate some of the effects. You can filter the data to view only Monday's figures WHERE WEEKDAY(whn) = 0. Show the number of new cases in Italy for each week in 2020 - show Monday only.
