8 Using Null

# 1 List the teachers who have NULL for their department.
  SELECT name
  FROM teacher
  WHERE dept IS NULL

# 2 Note the INNER JOIN misses the teachers with no department and the departments with no teacher.
  SELECT teacher.name, dept.name
  FROM teacher INNER JOIN dept
    ON (teacher.dept=dept.id)

# 3 Use a different JOIN so that all teachers are listed.
  SELECT teacher.name, dept.name
   FROM teacher LEFT JOIN dept
             ON (teacher.dept=dept.id)

# 4 Use a different JOIN so that all departments are listed.
  SELECT teacher.name, dept.name
   FROM teacher RIGHT JOIN dept
             ON (teacher.dept=dept.id)

# 5 Use COALESCE to print the mobile number. Use the number '07986 444 2266' if there is no number given. Show teacher name and mobile number or '07986 444 2266'
  SELECT name
  , COALESCE(mobile,  '07986 444 2266') AS mobile
  FROM teacher

# 6 Use the COALESCE function and a LEFT JOIN to print the teacher name and department name. Use the string 'None' where there is no department.
  SELECT t.name, COALESCE(d.name, 'None')
  FROM teacher AS t
  LEFT JOIN dept AS d
  ON t.dept = d.id

# 7 Use COUNT to show the number of teachers and the number of mobile phones.
  SELECT COUNT(name), COUNT(mobile)
  FROM teacher

# 8 Use COUNT and GROUP BY dept.name to show each department and the number of staff. Use a RIGHT JOIN to ensure that the Engineering department is listed.
  SELECT d.name, COUNT(t.name)
  FROM dept AS d
  LEFT JOIN teacher AS t
  ON t.dept = d.id
  GROUP BY d.name

# 9 Use CASE to show the name of each teacher followed by 'Sci' if the teacher is in dept 1 or 2 and 'Art' otherwise.
  SELECT name, 
       CASE WHEN dept IN (1, 2) 
          THEN "Sci"
          ELSE "Art"
         END AS name
   FROM teacher

# 10 Use CASE to show the name of each teacher followed by 'Sci' if the teacher is in dept 1 or 2, show 'Art' if the teacher's dept is 3 and 'None' otherwise.
  SELECT name, 
     CASE WHEN dept IN (1, 2) 
        THEN "Sci"
        WHEN dept = 3
           THEN "Art"
       ELSE
          "None"
